Final Considerations: 

District Summary

    •Calculate the total number of schools
    •Calculate the total number of students
    •Calculate the total budget
    •Calculate the average math score 
    •Calculate the average reading score
    •Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
    •Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
    •Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)
    •Create a dataframe to hold the above results
    •Optional: give the displayed data cleaner formatting

Trends:

    One Trend that I have noticed is that the lower budgets per students tend to have higher overall passing grades than the higher budgets per students. 
    Another trend I have noticed is that larger sized schools tend to have a considerably lower overall passing grades than a lower or mid sized-school.
    I have also noticed that gernerally speaking, students have higher reading scores than they do math scores.
